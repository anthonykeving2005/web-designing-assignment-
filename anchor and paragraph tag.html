        <h1>AB de Villiers</h1>
        <p>
            A 360-degree batter who could hit any ball anywhere, against any bowler, AB de Villiers was a bona fide South African great: a cricketer with overflowing talent and the temperament to back it up, a fielder able to leap tall buildings and still come up with the catch - and who could happily assume the wicketkeeper's spot if needed. As if all that wasn't enough, he was also a fine rugby player, golfer, and tennis player.
